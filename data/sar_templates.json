The customer opened their account on [ACCOUNT_OPEN_DATE] with an initial deposit of $[INITIAL_DEPOSIT]. The customer reported annual income of $[ANNUAL_INCOME] on their account opening documentation.\n\nWHAT\nBetween [START_DATE] and [END_DATE], the customer made [NUM_DEPOSITS] cash deposits totaling $[TOTAL_AMOUNT]. Each deposit was strategically kept below $10,000, ranging from $[MIN_AMOUNT] to $[MAX_AMOUNT]. The deposits followed a consistent pattern of occurring on [PATTERN_DESCRIPTION].\n\nWHEN\nThe suspicious activity began on [START_DATE] and continued through [END_DATE], spanning [NUM_DAYS] days. Deposits were made approximately [FREQUENCY] times per week, typically on [DAYS_OF_WEEK].\n\nWHERE\nAll deposits were made at [NUM_BRANCHES] different branch locations within the [GEOGRAPHIC_AREA] area. The customer alternated between branches with no apparent business rationale for the geographic distribution.\n\nWHY SUSPICIOUS\nThis activity is consistent with structuring, a money laundering technique used to evade Currency Transaction Report (CTR) filing requirements. The deliberate structuring of deposits below $10,000, combined with the use of multiple branches and consistent timing pattern, indicates intentional avoidance of Bank Secrecy Act reporting.\n\nHOW\nThe customer appears to be breaking larger amounts of cash into smaller deposits to avoid triggering CTR filings. The geographic distribution across multiple branches and the consistent timing suggest a sophisticated understanding of banking regulations.\n\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the pattern of cash deposits, multiple branch usage, and amounts consistently below reporting thresholds, this activity is being reported as suspected structuring. The bank has [ACTION_TAKEN] and will continue monitoring the account for further suspicious activity.\n",

The pattern accelerated significantly after [ACCELERATION_DATE], with transaction frequency increasing from [INITIAL_FREQUENCY] to [CURRENT_FREQUENCY].\n\nWHERE\nTransactions involved counterparties in [COUNTRIES], including [SPECIFIC_JURISDICTION] which is identified by FATF as having strategic AML deficiencies.
